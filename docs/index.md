# Documentation for OpenWindMap API v1

Welcome!

From the inception, the OpenWindMap network was built with the idea of making its data available in an open and easily reusable way.

We believe that the value is not the data, but the innovative uses **you** will create from it.

## API endpoints

### Measurements
* [Live]: latest measurements
* [Archive]: historical data
* [Push]: real-time feed using [Socket.IO]

## License

To use data from the OpenWindMap network, you must comply with the license available on the [Data Licensing] page.
